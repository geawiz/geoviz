# GeoViz Tutorials
This repository is a collection of tutorials that should help you rendering maps on the Web. The main objective of these tutorials is to illustrate how to add layers of data to base maps. For this, we will be using the amazing [MapLibre GL JS](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js) library. Most of the tutorials will have code examples in two different flavour: plain HTML, as well as [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org) components.
Our tutorials emphasize a modern, serverless approach to web mapping. Rather than depending on dedicated map servers (like GeoServer or MapServer), we:
- Store processed raster and vector data economically on cloud-based storage solutions (Amazon S3).
- Utilize client-side rendering capabilities of [MapLibre GL JS](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js) for efficient, scalable, and cost-effective mapping.

To follow along, we tried to limit hardware requirements and local software dependencies. All you need is:
- [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) to host your website.
- [Google Colab](https://colab.google) for data processing.
- [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) or similar object storage to host your data.

Let's get started creating interactive, beautiful, and scalable web maps!

## Tutorial outline
This repo provides a practical, hands-on approach to display maps on the Web. We will cover all the steps involved in displaying data localized on maps, in an incremental fashion. 

| Module | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| [Getting Started](./0_getting-started) | Set up your dev environment for the main tutorials | âœ… | 
| [Display a Base Map](./1_simple-map) | Learn how to use [maplibre-gl-js](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js) to display a base map| âœ… |
| [Working with PMTiles files](./2_PMTiles-map) | Learn how to create `PMTiles` files from vector data and display them on a map using the `pmtiles` protocol | âœ… |
| [Working with Cloud Optimized GEOTiff files](./3_Cloud-Optimized-GeoTIFF) | Learn how to access `COG` files to display data on a base map | ðŸš§ WIP |
| [Dynamically Render Layers](./4_layer-list) | Create a list of checkboxes that dynamically render the available layers on a base map | âœ… | 

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following:
- Basic understanding of maps and HTML/Web development.
- Familiarity with Python, HTML/Vue and the [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/) library.
- Access to a AWS S3 bucket for some of the tutorials (more info in the [Getting Started](./0_getting-started) tutorial).

## Tech stack

The tutorials in this repository leverage the following tech stack

- Python3 and shell scripts for [data processing](./dataprocessing).
-  [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org), TypeScript, [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) to build the tutorials [website](./site).

### Recommended Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Vue - Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (previously Volar) and disable Vetur.
