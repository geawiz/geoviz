# GeoViz

This is the main repo for ``GeoViz`` tutorials.

# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite + Vuetify

This website is built using [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org), TypeScript and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev). [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) is used as the Component Framework and UI library.

## Recommended Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Vue - Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (previously Volar) and disable Vetur.

## How to develop and build
First run ``pnpn install`` to install all dependencies required to build.

Then to develop run:
``npm run dev``
(or clikc theplay icon in the NPM SCRIPT panel on the left side of VSCode)
which serves a development version of this website. So you can use hot-reloading and make changes on the fly.

Finally, when happy, run 
``npm run build``
which builds the static website in a subfolder called ``docs``.

In the end, commit all change. If oyu also commit the 'docs' folder, this will change the live website to the latest built version.
